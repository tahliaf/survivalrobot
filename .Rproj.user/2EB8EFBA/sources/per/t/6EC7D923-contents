Version: 0.1.0

Description: MAKE SURE YOU HAVE A BACKUP OF THE IMAGES STORED SOMEWHERE SAFE BEFORE USING THIS FUNCTION!
   ONCE YOU USE THE FUNCTION, THERE IS NO GOING BACK, PLEASE HAVE A BACKUP OF YOUR DATA!!!
    The group.files() function should be pointed at the folder containing raw images from the Johnson lab robot, you should then decide whether the files need to be renamed or not.
    Renaming the files is a must if you have multiple runs on the robot for the same experiment, otherwise the files will not be in order for ImageJ processing once grouped.
        If you have only 1 run, then you do not need to rename, and can set this as FALSE - it will take less time to execute this way
